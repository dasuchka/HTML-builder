ignificant when the storage of GNDs is comparable to SSDs, lead- ing to the second-order effect. Such a strain-gradient effect, asso- ciated with GNDs, has been introduced into CP model by two ap- proaches. One is based on high-order CP theory that requires addi- tional boundary conditions which are difficult to determine phys- ically ( Reuber et al., 2014 ). The other being a lower-order strain- gradient CP theory, where the storage of GNDs are introduced into the evolution of SSDs and calculation of slip-system resistance ( Ma et al., 2006 ). Our primary goal is to characterize both the first-order and second-order effects in small-scale single crystals using a CP the- ory. Three phenomenological relationships are proposed to de- scribe the first-order effect based on micro-pillar compression experiments and discrete dislocation dynamics (DDD) simulation studies. A low-order strain-gradient CP approach is adopted to in- troduce the second-order effect in the current study. Contribu- tions of the second-order effect, in addition to the first-order one, are estimated from cantilever-beam experimental data. Numerical studies show that the proposed modelling framework is capable to characterise size effects under macroscopically homogeneous and in-homogeneous loading states. The paper is organized as follows: in Section 2 , a self-contained description of the governing relations of proposed size-dependent CP model is presented. Section 3 comprises a finite-element mod- elling strategy implemented in a general commercial finite element software package ABAQUS. In Section 4 , results of the implementa- tion are presented and discussed. The paper ends with some con- cluding remarks in Section 5 . 2.
Constitutive description of first-order and second-order effects
In this section, a phenomenological size-dependent crystal plas- ticity (SDCP) model is proposed, which accounts for the first-order and second-order effects of crystalline metals. Standard notations are adopted here: scalars are in italics, vectors and tensors are rep- resented with lower-case and upper-case bold letters. First, for completeness, the classical CP theory adopted in this study is reviewed. Deformation gradient F , can be decomposed into the elastic and plastic parts ( Roters et al., 2010 ), as,
